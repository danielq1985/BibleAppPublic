# Bible Context 

This is a bible resource designed to bring context to each verse.

### Background:
The bible is a library of books written by many authors over a thousand years ago. There are hundreds to thousands of people, places, and other bible verses referenced throughout the bible. The project's objective is to bring context to the text verse by verse. **The power of context brings the scriptures to life.** 

### Tech used:
  Python, Flask, Pandas, Folium, Requests(JSON), Heroku
  
### Screenshots: 
A side-by-side interface makes it easy to explore the main scripture while diving into cross-references, people, and places (with maps!) easy.

*Note: this was deployed on a Heroku hobby-grade server so it may take 15 seconds to load the 1st time of use*

### What's next?
Bringing cultural context! Understanding the culture of ancient people will level up the project's ability to bring the scriptures to life.
